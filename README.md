# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).
## Algorithm:
1.Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

2.Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). Justify your method choice.

3.Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

4.Create at least two user personas with Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points.

#### Output:
### Scenario 1: Designing a Mobile Health & Wellness Tracking App
## Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

Users struggle to keep track of health metrics across multiple apps (e.g., steps, sleep, mood).

They feel overwhelmed by complex dashboards and unclear data insights.

They have difficulty maintaining long-term health habits because progress is not communicated in a motivating way.

Users forget to track data manually, leading to inconsistent habits.

## UX Problem Statements

Health-conscious users need a way to easily consolidate and understand their wellness data because current health information is scattered across multiple apps, which results in confusion and low motivation.

Busy adults need a way to receive simple, timely reminders for their health habits because they often forget to log their progress, which results in inconsistent tracking and difficulty reaching long-term goals.

## Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

User Interviews
To understand personal motivations, emotional challenges, and subjective definitions of “wellness.”

Surveys
To collect broad data on tracking habits, app usage, feature expectations, and pain point frequency.

Diary Studies
To observe daily health tracking behavior and identify moments of friction or abandonment.

Usability Testing (Prototype)
To validate navigation ease, dashboard clarity, and reminder flow effectiveness.
